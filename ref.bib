    abstract = {When you write papers, how many times do you want to make some citations at a place
    but you are not sure which papers to cite? Do you wish to have a recommendation system
    which can recommend a small number of good candidates for every place that you want
    to make some citations? In this paper, we present our initiative of building a context-aware
    citation recommendation system. High quality citation recommendation is challenging:
    not only should the citations recommended be relevant to the paper under composition,
    but also should match the local contexts of the places citations are made. Moreover,
    it is far from trivial to model how the topic of the whole paper and the contexts
    of the citation places should affect the selection and ranking of citations. To tackle
    the problem, we develop a context-aware approach. The core idea is to design a novel
    non-parametric probabilistic model which can measure the context-based relevance between
    a citation context and a document. Our approach can recommend citations for a context
    effectively. Moreover, it can recommend a set of citations for a paper with high quality.
    We implement a prototype system in CiteSeerX. An extensive empirical evaluation in
    the CiteSeerX digital library against many baselines demonstrates the effectiveness
    and the scalability of our approach.},

    activities since it can substantially improve the efficiency and quality of literature
    search. The prior techniques placed a considerable burden on users, who were required
    to provide a representative bibliography or to mark passages where citations are needed.
    In this paper we present a system that considerably reduces this burden: a user simply
    inputs a query manuscript (without a bibliography) and our system automatically finds
    locations where citations are needed. We show that na\"{\i}ve approaches do not work well
    due to massive noise in the document corpus. We produce a successful approach by carefully
    examining the relevance between segments in a query manuscript and the representative
    segments extracted from a document corpus. An extensive empirical evaluation using
    the CiteSeerX data set shows that our approach is effective.},

    abstract = {Adequacy of citations is very important for a scientific paper. However, it is not
    an easy job to find appropriate citations for a given context, especially for citations
    in different languages. In this paper, we define a novel task of cross-language context-aware
    citation recommendation, which aims at recommending English citations for a given
    context of the place where a citation is made in a Chinese paper. This task is very
    challenging because the contexts and citations are written in different languages
    and there exists a language gap when matching them. To tackle this problem, we propose
    the bilingual context-citation embedding algorithm (i.e. BLSRec-I), which can learn
    a low-dimensional joint embedding space for both contexts and citations. Moreover,
    two advanced algorithms named BLSRec-II and BLSRec-III are proposed by enhancing BLSRec-I
    with translation results and abstract information, respectively. We evaluate the proposed
    methods based on a real dataset that contains Chinese contexts and English citations.
    The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can outperform a few baselines
    and the BLSRec-II and BLSRec-III methods can outperform the BLSRec-I method.},

    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

    feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features
    is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses:
    they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For
    example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose
    Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations
    from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents.
    Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict
    words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome
    the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors
    outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations.
    Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and
    sentiment analysis tasks.},

Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.",
